                and a veteran, I have an extremely precise attention to detail and an honest work ethic that I bring to
                the table.</p>


            <p>Some of my areas of expertise include:</p>
            <p>
                --Web development--<br>

                --Lots of stuff that doesn't relate to coding whatsoever--<br>
                --Always looking for ways to simplify things while still accomplishing the task on time and under
                budget--<br>

            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>I was born in Florida and from an early age, the mechanical world has always fascinated me. Anything with
                moving parts captivated
                me, and so began a long journey learning how everything with wings, wheels or a hull functions and
                interacts with its operational environment. At age ten, I became the youngest
                person to complete the US Coast Guard Boating Skills and Seamanship course. I began sailing a year later
                and entered my first sailboat race at age 12 and quickly moved up to larger boats, skippering a Thistle
                in the 1992 Nationals at age 14. </p>

            <p>When I was 15, my family moved to Vermont and through a chance meeting
                of a gentleman that owned an airplane, I began flying and so began my fascination with aviation. As luck
                would have it, a neighbor was a retired aeronautical engineer who took me under his wing and taught me
                about aerodynamics and structural design. Not long after, I began designing and flying my own model
                planes. Some flew great. Others flew great as well, but only for the few seconds they were in the air
                until they succumbed to the mysteries of gravity in an explosion of balsa. </p>

            <p>Once I got my drivers license, my focus shifted yet
                again towards cars. It wasn't long after that I began turning my own wrenches and looking for ways to
                make what I had better. I began racing autocross after high school and was picked up by an amateur
                racing team a few years later. We won some and we lost some, and we wrecked some and fixed some. </p>

            <p>In my
                late 20's, I answered the call to serve my country, enlisting in the USAF. After three combat
                deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan within a five year time span, I felt I had given all I reasonably
                could and volunteered for an early separation via a reduction in force program in place at the time. In
                return I received a generous separation package that included full veterans benefits and an honorable
                discharge. While I was in the military I discovered motorcycles and as per my modus operandi, I began
                racing without much delay. </p>

            <p>After I separated from the military, I decided to turn my passion for performance motorcycles
                into a job and opened up shop in my garage. It was honestly probably the most difficult thing I've ever
                done because every single waking moment was a hustle to drum up work, promote my business, and find that
                fine balance with customers between friend and proprieter. An opportunity to return to federal service
                as a civilian aircraft electrician emerged and I gladly seized it. Which brings me to today. </p>

            <p>I've
                dabbled in web design off and on since the internet became accessible to the masses, but never under any
                instruction. It has held my interest, but only at a recreational level mainly due to its intangible
                nature. After much thought and deliberation, I decided to throw myself at it with the same gusto and
                enthusiasm as I've always done with anything that has captivated my mind. I am greatly looking forward
                to including this adventure in my list of life experiences, goals, and accomplishments.</p>
